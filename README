Math::Roman - calc with Roman numbers

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

This needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat, as they are
on CPAN as 'Math::BigInt' or in Perl newer than v5.7.1.

To test, untar, unzip and then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
